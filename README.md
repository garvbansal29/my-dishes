# APPLE-PIE
###### An apple pie is a pie in which the main filling ingredient is apple. It is often served with whipped cream or ice cream. It is generally double-layered, with pastry both above and below filling; the upper layer is solid. The bottom layer is baked separately to prevent it from getting wet or soft.
